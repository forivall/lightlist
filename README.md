# forivall's lightlist

A lightweight Adblocking list that _only_ blocks ads that
 * Load Flash (F)
 * Are animated (A)
 * Serve dumb content-farm "related" links (C)
 * Significantly degrade the performance of websites (D)

PRs should include some kind of documentation about what the advertising
provider does that deserves blocking. The list should also be kept in
alphabetical order.

This list was created because most lists block thedeck and projectwonderful,
which are simple, well designed, not annoying ad networks.
